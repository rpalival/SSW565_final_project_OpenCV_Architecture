\section{Description\label{Section::ArchitectureIntro}}
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library \cite{OCV}) is an open-source library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms. It has a modular structure architecture, which means that the package includes several modules with shared or static libraries. 

\section{Modules \label{subSection::ModulesList}}

\section{Grouping Modules\label{Section::GroupingModules}}
The modules don't have a clear order or hierarchy. Core, python, and java are commonly used modules, but there isn't a definite separation between them. Often, a module that uses the core module also depends on another module, which makes the structure very complex.\\\\
However, we can group all the modules in three categories:
\begin{enumerate}
     \item Main Functionality
     \item Extended Functionality
     \item High Level GUI
\end{enumerate}

\section{15 Most Important Modules\label{Section::HighLevelView}}
Below is a figure of the 15 most important modules in the three categories discussed above:

\section{4+1 View of Architecture\label{Section::4+1view}}
The 4+1 architectural view model provides multiple perspectives on the architecture of a system \cite{UNB}. Such as:
\begin{enumerate}

\subsection{Logical View\label{subSection::LogicalView}} \index{Logical View}
The logical view is an architectural view that focuses on representing the high-level structure and organization of the system's functionality and behavior. It provides an abstraction of the system's functionality and its relationships, without delving into implementation details. \\\\
     In our case we will consider the following:
     \begin{itemize}

\end{figure}
The logical view of OpenCV's Image Stitching module describes the system's functionality and the relationships between its components. The module consists of several classes, including the Stitcher class, Features Matcher class, Plane Warper class, Blender class, BundleAdjusterBaseClass, and Estimator class. Here is a brief description of each class and how they depend on each other:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stitcher class: The Stitcher class is the main class in the Image Stitching module. It provides the functionality to stitch multiple images together to create a panoramic image. The Stitcher class uses other classes in the module to perform various tasks, such as feature detection, feature matching, and image blending.
    \item Features Matcher class: The Features Matcher class is responsible for detecting and matching features in the input images. It uses various algorithms to detect and match features, such as the SIFT algorithm and the SURF algorithm.
    \item Plane Warper class: The Plane Warper class is responsible for warping the input images to a common plane. It uses various algorithms to perform the warping, such as the Homography algorithm and the Affine algorithm.

    \item Estimator class: The Estimator class is responsible for estimating the camera parameters of the input images. It uses various algorithms to estimate the parameters, such as the RANSAC algorithm and the Least Squares algorithm.\\
\end{enumerate}
These classes depend on each other in a hierarchical manner. The Stitcher class is the main class that uses the other classes to perform various tasks. The Features Matcher class and the Estimator class are used by the Stitcher class to detect and match features and estimate camera parameters, respectively. The Plane Warper class is used by the Stitcher class to warp the input images to a common plane.

\end{figure}
The process view of OpenCV's Image Stitching module describes the system's behavior and how it responds to external events. The module performs several operations to stitch multiple images together to create a panoramic image. Here is a brief description of each operation and the steps involved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Step 1 - Input Images:\\ The first operation is to input the images that need to be stitched together. These images are typically captured using a camera or downloaded from a source.

    \item Step 2 - Registration:\\ The second operation is registration, which involves several steps:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Resize (medium resolution): The input images are resized to a medium resolution to reduce the computational complexity of the feature detection and matching algorithms.
        \item Find features: The feature detection algorithm is used to detect features in the input images, such as corners, edges, and blobs.
        \item Match features: The feature matching algorithm is used to match the features between the input images.

        \item Estimate camera parameters rough initial guess: The camera parameters of the input images are estimated using a rough initial guess.
        \item Refine camera parameters globally: The camera parameters are refined globally using a bundle adjustment algorithm.
        \item Wave correction: The wave correction algorithm is used to correct the distortion caused by the camera lens.
        \item Final panorama scale estimation: The final scale of the panorama is estimated based on the camera parameters and the input images.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Step 3 - Registration data :\\ The registration data, including the camera parameters and the warped images, are passed to the compositing operation.

    \item Step 4 - Compositing:\\ The final operation is compositing, which involves several steps:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Warp images: The warped images are transformed to a common coordinate system using the estimated camera parameters.
        \item Estimate exposure errors: The exposure errors in the input images are estimated using an exposure estimation algorithm.
        \item Compensate exposure errors: The exposure errors in the input images are compensated using an exposure compensation algorithm.
        \item Resize (low resolution): The final panoramic image is resized to a low resolution for display or storage purposes.
        \item Warp images: The warped images are transformed again to the original resolution.
        \item Find seam masks: The seam masks are found using a seam finding algorithm.
        \item Resize masks to original resolution: The seam masks are resized to the original resolution.
        \item Blend images: The blended image is created by blending the warped images together using a blending algorithm.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Step 5 - Final panorama:\\ The final panoramic image is created by combining the blended image and the seam masks.
\end{enumerate}
Overall, the process view of OpenCV's Image Stitching module describes the system's behavior and how it responds to external events, such as input images and user requests. The module performs several operations, including registration and compositing, to stitch multiple images together to create a beautiful panoramic image.
