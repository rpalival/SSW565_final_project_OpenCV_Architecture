\par{The purpose of this document is to provide a overview of openCV's architecture and a comprehensive overview of the software architecture for OpenCV's Image Stitching module \cite{openCVReport}. The document outlines the key stakeholders, user requirements, business requirements, quality attributes \cite{qualityattributes}, and risks involved in the system, and provides a detailed description of the architecture from multiple perspectives. The document is intended to serve as a reference for developers, project managers, and other stakeholders who need to understand the system and its architecture. By providing a clear and detailed description of the system's architecture, the document helps ensure that the system is designed and implemented in a way that meets the needs and requirements of its stakeholders, while also addressing potential risks and quality issues. Overall, the purpose of this document is to facilitate effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders, and to ensure the successful development and deployment of the OpenCV Image Stitching module.}\\

\par{Overall, the 4+1 view model provides a comprehensive understanding of the OpenCV Image Stitching module's architecture from multiple perspectives, helping stakeholders to understand the system's functionality, behavior, development environment, physical architecture, and user requirements. This understanding is essential for ensuring that the system is designed and implemented in a way that meets the needs and requirements of its stakeholders, while also addressing potential risks and quality issues.
